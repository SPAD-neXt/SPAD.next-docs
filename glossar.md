## SimConnect

SimConnect is a synonym for a protocol Microsoft published together with the FSX Acceleration Pack/SP2. All simulations that are based on FSX \(this includes Prepare3D and MS Flight Simulator 2020\) support this protocol. For a complete description of SimConnect and its feature please see [Microsoft's ESP Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/microsoft-esp/cc526948%28v=msdn.10%29).
