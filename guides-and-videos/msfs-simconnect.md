# MSFS SimConnect

At FSExpo 2023 I was able to give a talk on how SimConnect works from the "users" point of view.  The goal was to breakdown the way in which 3rd party planes and interfaces work.  Also targeting the how and Why things work the way they do.  Note that this was in 2023 and most of the information is still accurate with the exception that we DO have access now to Send B:Events.

How SimConnect Works - From The User Perspective
{% endembed %}

During Flight Sim Expo 2025 I had the opportunity to deliver another presentation regarding how users can leverage the SDK to understand better configuring hardware!

With the release SU15 in MSFS 2020, then further in 2024 Release many updates and capabilities were exposed. These Improvements open even more possibilities for the user! MSFS 2024 DEV Mode is even more powerful for quickly identifying controls to be bound!

Thank you again to the FSA team that puts together these great Events! Especially to all the people that volunteer at the event to help make it happen for the community!
