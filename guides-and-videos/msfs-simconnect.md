# MSFS SimConnect

At FSExpo 2023 I was able to give a talk on how SimConnect works from the "users" point of view.  The goal was to breakdown the way in which 3rd party planes and interfaces work.  Also targeting the how and Why things work the way they do.  Note that this was in 2023 and most of the information is still accurate with the exception that we DO have access now to Send B:Events.
