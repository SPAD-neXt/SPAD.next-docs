Binding Buttons and Axis in SPAD.neXt does not replace the sim bindings.  Make sure that you create blank MSFS Profiles or you will end up with "doubling of events".

Before we start configuring our Hardware in SPAD.neXt we need to remove the Bindings from MSFS 2024 on the devices we plan to use.  If we leave behind assignments in MSFS 2024 then those events will still fire!  So let's Clean it up quickly!<br>

MSFS 2020 and MSFS 2024 Require the L:VAR Bridge to function properly.  This is also the H:Event Gateway as those have to be done via the WASM Module as well.  In FSX/P3D it is not "required" unless you are using advanced planes.. which well makes it required.  Also same Wizard area for installing the XPlane Plugin.\

Custom Axis are powerful and understanding the control parameters and how to use them is important!  With MSFS now using the \_EX1 extended axis there are planes that won't support or work when it is a "Standard" simconnect axis.  This video will explain the Advanced capabilities that you can achieve with ease in SPAD.neXt !!

Programming LEDs! Extensive power and capability for lighting and Flashing LEDs was always available. With this though meant "simple" LED assignment required a little more complexity like having to assign at least TWO change types for even a basic ON / OFF pairing.

With v0.9.15 the NEW LED system (also now common accross most devices!) offers a few options on how to Link the LEDs! The New system is really cool and offers quicker mapping and direct copy paste between devices!!
