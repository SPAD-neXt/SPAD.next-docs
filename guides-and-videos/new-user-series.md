3rd Installment is all about understanding Button and Switch modes for Joysticks.... Before we even start to assign them we need to think about the best way to configure the hardware use... Hidden Gem for sure!

Well Looks like we needed a 3.1 in the New User Series....  With Version 0.9.12.x and greater we now have a new implementation to the Button Modes.  All Three Pushbutton / Simple Pushbutton and Switch can be accomplished with the "Pushbutton" Mode plus some new elements and tweaks as well!!  With the release on the horizon there will be some editing but don't worry.. the Change Trigger To edit event will save the day!!

4th Installment is about Axis ... When putting them in Spad is better ![:slight\_smile:](https://discord.com/assets/da3651e59d6006dfa5fa07ec3102d1f3.svg) always... But also what is the difference between Standard and Custom Axis along with how to use the features in the Custom Axis..

5th Installment is all about "clean up"...  Connecting the Logitech/Saitek Panels in SPAD.neXt usually means that there is some software to remove and some power management to deal with.  Follow these steps before we move on to pulling in configurations for devices.

6th Installment we take a Multi panel from Zero to Hero in the first 5 Minutes!  How to easily download the configuration you need from the "ONLINE SNIPPET" Database.  This one we use the Example of the WT CJ4 and after the first 5 minutes we break down the configuration and assignments!

8th episode we go into the Switch Panel Configuration...  Download a panel for the C172 and then we walk through the "HOW" we figure out the events.  This is done by leveraging the Event Monitor which allows us to interact in the cockpit and see what events that is setting off in the sim!!

Installment 9 in the series focuses on working with the Data Monitor and how to use it monitor data changes from cockpit elements.  Additionally using it to change the data in the sim to see if that data will trigger events as well :)

Number 10 we go into the Event Monitor and walk through some examples in the TBM on how to figure out which events are send when buttons and switches are moved...  And how to use that to setup buttons and controls in a similar way!

Installment 11 in the series moves on to the Stream Deck!  You do require the Complete Edition for the Stream Deck to function under SPAD.neXt but it is pretty impressive what you can do with it!!  In this video we set out to get it configured on the Elgato software side and then move into SPAD.neXt and walk through that setup.  Finally we pull in an amazing example from the online database that works with the WT CJ4!

Custom Axis are powerful and understanding the control parameters and how to use them is important!  With MSFS now using the \_EX1 extended axis there are planes that won't support or work when it is a "Standard" simconnect axis.  This video will explain the Advanced capabilities that you can achieve with ease in SPAD.neXt !!
