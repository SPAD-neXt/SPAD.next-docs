Custom Axis are powerful and understanding the control parameters and how to use them is important!

Programming LEDs! Extensive power and capability for lighting and Flashing LEDs was always available. With this though meant "simple" LED assignment required a little more complexity like having to assign at least TWO change types for even a basic ON / OFF pairing.

With v0.9.15 the NEW LED system (also now common accross most devices!) offers a few options on how to Link the LEDs! The New system is really cool and offers quicker mapping and direct copy paste between devices!!
