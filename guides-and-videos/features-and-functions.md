# Features & Functions

Conditional Events and Local Variables are powerful for creating intelligent actions.  We may want to have multiple things on a single Button or Encoder.  We can use conditions to allow them to figure out which event to send on that click!  In this Video we use Multiple Conditions and a Local Variable to create our own Acceleration Events!!

Condition Levers in the 208 and King Air were removed in SU6 ..  New Events were added in SU7 but they are not in the SDK currently... We will use vJoy to work around it :)

How to Remove the Warning about Trim Percent and Replace those actions using Trim Position instead!  This video shows you how to do that and explain why this warning is now appearing.  Also great example using the Event Monitor and Data Monitor Features!! &#x20;

From time to time the SDK can be updated or other developers like Fly By Wire may add their own sim events that SPAD.neXt is not aware of yet.  In those situations you can leverage the Client Events Tab in the Menu to add in any of these events that are missing..

SPAD.neXt has a very useful Text to Speech Feature.  In this short Feature video we use it to setup button events and script events to have the Bravo and Multipanel tell us what their selectors are assigned to!

Another application where we needed to use Local Variables, Expressions and Conditions to make the Radio Panel operate in a different mode of operation for the transponder.  The operational result is a way to visualize how to leverage these SPAD.neXt features to enhance your sim experience!!

Use Local Variables and Conditional Events to put Multiple Functions onto a single Knob.  Here we use the example of toggling a Variable on the X-Touch by pushing the Knob to flip between Heading and Speed Controls.  We also setup a second Local Variable to make the Second Knob flip between Altitude adjustment in 100 Foot increments to 1000 Foot Increments.

Well this one is kind of a Feature ...  Using  the vJoy Axis we can make an indirect link to the throttle.  We do this so that the TBM 930 Throttle will move in the cockpit by mapping the MSFS control bindings for the vJoy to the Throttle Axis.  Then we use Spad to map out hardware controller Axis to the vJoy Axis...  Now we have the same freedom to re map controllers and auto switch profiles!

This Video focuses on using a Local Variable that we Create to Allow us to assign conditions to what the Radio Panel will Display.  This example focuses on the Radio Panel and switching between displaying Baro in in/HG or MB but could be applied to anything!!
