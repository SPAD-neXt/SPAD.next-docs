# AS CRJ 550/700 \(MSFS\)

Step 1...  You need to Get the L:VAR Bridge Installed... v0.9.10.17 or Higher.  You only need to be in Alpha or Beta channels if you are not on at least v0.9.10.17...

Step 2...  We need to Learn how to Find the Data using the Data Monitor.  Also how we can then interact with that Data to make changes.  We can use the Switch Panel for this one!

Step 3... Let's now take what we learned in the previous video and get the Multi Panel working with the AS CRJ FCP.  In this one we are going to learn about how some items need additional commands if we want to also have the Knobs and Buttons Animate and make Sounds in the cockpit!

Step 4...  Onwards to the Radio Panel configuration!  Also since not all of the data has L:Vars \(Nav Radio STBY\) or initially the CRJ was not updating Transponder State we will use Data and Script Panels to work around them.
