# WT CJ4 \(MSFS\)

Working Title has heavily modified the CJ4 and with that required introducing L:Vars and H:Events.  The Custom Autopilot system they built uses these Variables and Events to create the shim between the Default Autopilot system and their custom FMS and FMC changes to the Proline 21 system.  Specific videos to configuring devices for the WT CJ4 Mod.  Some videos may be found in other sections as well. 

With the Switch Panel we will configure it so that we can perform a Full Cold and Dark Startup of the CJ4, We will also add some conditions to the Avionics so that we can go into Dispatch mode when the GENs are off or go into Full Mode when they are On!   the full electrics panel is mapped and so is the Left side of the Lights panel.

Take the CJ4 from Working Title v0.12.7 and configure the Logitech Multi Panel to have full control over the FCP \(auto pilot\).  Using the H:Events and L:Vars to have complete control over this really well done Plane!
