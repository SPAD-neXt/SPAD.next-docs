# Feature / Functions

Conditional Events and Local Variables are powerful for creating intelligent actions.  We may want to have multiple things on a single Button or Encoder.  We can use conditions to allow them to figure out which event to send on that click!  In this Video we use Multiple Conditions and a Local Variable to create our own Acceleration Events!!
