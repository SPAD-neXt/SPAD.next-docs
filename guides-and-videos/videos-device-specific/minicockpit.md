miniCockpit's miniFCU is fully supported in SPAD.neXt v0.9.15.38 and Newer.  Upgrading the Firmware to the Custom SPAD.neXt frimware (written by miniCockpit) enables the additional event abillities like Press Short, Press Long, Press, Release and Held for Buttons.  LEDs / DOTs and Labels are also now independent from the "Airbus" Modes for additional Customization.
