Videos for the miniCockpit Products

miniCOCKPIT's miniFCU is fully supported in SPAD.neXt v0.9.15.38 and Newer.  Upgrading the Firmware to the Custom SPAD.neXt firmware (written by miniCOCKPIT) enables the additional event abilities like Press Short, Press Long, Press, Release and Held for Buttons.  LEDs / DOTs and Labels are also now independent from the "Airbus" Modes for additional Customization.\

In Release Version 0.9.23.31 - SPAD.neXt now Uploads and Controls the Firmware for miniCOCKPIT Devices.  Additionally this version added the support for the miniEFIS as well.  The previous Video is now removed as there is no longer a need to manually change the firmware via external Software.
