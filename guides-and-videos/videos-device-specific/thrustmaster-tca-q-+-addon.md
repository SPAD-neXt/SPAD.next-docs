Plenty of Jets have Throttle FADEC Detents!  Let's use Multiple Custom Axis to map these into custom ranges on the Throttle Axis!  This method would work for any Throttle since it does not rely on the TCA TQ's Virtual Detent Buttons!

For the First Device Tutorial Regarding the PMDG 777 I decided to use an Airbus Setup :).  The TCA Airbus Captains Pack! This is just what happens to be at my desk vs in the main simulator.
