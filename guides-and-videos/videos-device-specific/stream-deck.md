Vision Jet v2 VAMS Stream Deck Mapping
{% endembed %}

I have been wanting to cover the "Quadster" I have been working on for some time...  Thanks again to Shakeprint for working with me to make this custom mount. &#x20;

With the Vision Jet v2.1 on the path to release I felt updating the Stream Deck Device Snippet would be a great time to tie in the Quadster and show it off!!  There is a lot to unpack with 22 pages of StreamDeck Control tied to 4 Dual Concentric Encoders!!
