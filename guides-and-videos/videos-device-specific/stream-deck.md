I have been wanting to cover the "Quadster" I have been working on for some time... Thanks again to Shakeprint for working with me to make this custom mount.

With the Vision Jet v2.1 on the path to release I felt updating the Stream Deck Device Snippet would be a great time to tie in the Quadster and show it off!! There is a lot to unpack with 22 pages of StreamDeck Control tied to 4 Dual Concentric Encoders!!

Create Custom Made Keypads for controlling Sim Variables via Stream Deck. In this video we use the example of the HJet and G3000 GTC touch control of the Com and Nav Frequency entry. This can be applied to other variables where Data Entry is desired.

Stream Deck Image Animations

In this video we show how to use Data to dynamically Animate Images. We use Transparent Images to layer over Text and a Variable to drive it.

Expressions in SPAD.neXt are extremely powerful and the Rescale Function is used to easily remap the L:Var to the Rotation value required!
