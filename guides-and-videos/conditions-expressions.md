# Conditions / Expressions

Conditions enable a user to apply "rules or approvals" as to when an Assignment to any Button, Axis, Switch, Encoder — etc .. are allowed to be sent.  This Enables users to bind numerous sets of assignments with independent logic for when they will be enabled.&#x20;

Conditional Templates allow creating a single or series of conditions that can them be wrapped up into a "human readable" Label which can then be quickly selected from a drop down list.  This will Super Charge Assignments of complex Condition Sequences and speed up device configuration!

Examples are built in this Guide for the PMDG 737-800 in MSFS 2024 using a TCA Boeing Throttle but the premise can be applied to any number of devices as it covers: Throttles, Rev Switches, AP Mode Selectors and Encoders + Buttons with Multiple Assignments based on Modes.
