# Operators





## Operators

Expressions can be combined using operators. Each operator as a precedence priority. Here is the list of those expression's priority.

### Logical

These operators can do some logical comparison between other expressions:

* or, \|\|
* and, &&

 The **and** operator has more prioroty thand the **or**, thus in the example above, **false and true** is evaluated first.

### Relational

* =, ==, !=, &lt;&gt;
* &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=

### Additive

* +, -

### Multiplicative

* \*, /, %

### Bitwise

* & \(bitwise and\), \| \(bitwise or\), ^\(bitwise xor\), &lt;&lt; \(left shift\), &gt;&gt;\(right shift\)

  > 2 &gt;&gt; 3

  **Unary**

* !, not, -, ~ \(bitwise not\)

### Primary

* \(, \)

$$2 * ( 3 +2)$$
