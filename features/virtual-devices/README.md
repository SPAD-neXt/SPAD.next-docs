# Virtual Devices

SPAD.neXt offers some virtual devices, which can be opened in a web browser.\
Those devices behave exactly like the physical devices, just that you have to "press" buttons using the mouse or touchpad.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Virtual Devices is an extended feature and seperately licensed. Either the complete edition of SPAD.neXt or the vFIP Addon is needed.
{% endhint %}

[vFIP - virtual FIP](vfip.md)

The vFIP is a virtual Flight Instrument Panel, which behaves exactly as the hardware device. You can detach it from SPAD.neXt and move it freely around.&#x20;

[vDeck - virtual Streamdeck](vdeck.md)

The vDeck is a  virtual image button device, just like e.g. an Elgate STreamdeck or Loupedeck.&#x20;
