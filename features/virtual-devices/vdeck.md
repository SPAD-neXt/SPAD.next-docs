# vDeck

(Work in Progress, check back later)

Add a vDeck in Settings->Devices->Virtual Devices

* It behaves exactly like a streamdeck
* Click on the detach button to open it as a web device
* you can customize the webinterface by editing Documents/SPAD.neXt/html/VDCK0001.html
* if you customize html or css and want to prevent spad overwriting your changes create a file "vdeck001.html.disableUpdates"/"vdck.css.disableUpdates"
* your must not change the title in the html, as it is used to identify the vdeck to connect to
* For remote access open "http://`ipofSPAD`:28001/VDCK0001.html" in a browser
