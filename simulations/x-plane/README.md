# X-Plane

### ✈️ Welcome to the X-Plane Hangar

Alright, Captain—strap in, because we’re about to taxi into the world of **X-Plane + SPAD.neXt integration**. If you’ve been flying SPAD.neXt in the Microsoft Flight Sim skies, welcome to the slightly weirder, wonderfully flexible (and occasionally stubborn) world of X-Plane.

This part of the manual is your pre-flight briefing for everything SPAD.neXt does once it’s cleared into X-Plane airspace. From finding the right **datarefs**, to working with **custom aircraft commands**, to making your cockpit hardware talk to your sim like they’ve been best friends since flight school—this is where the magic happens.

But don’t worry—we’re not going to throw you into the left seat without a checklist. We’ll guide you step-by-step, with just enough humor to keep things from feeling like you're stuck in a holding pattern over the tech manual.

#### What to Expect:

* Hooking SPAD.neXt into X-Plane like a seasoned avionics tech
* Making sense of datarefs (without needing a PhD in sim-ology)
* Creating button magic with custom commands
* Troubleshooting things when X-Plane throws a tantrum

So grab a coffee, fire up your sim, and let’s turn that cockpit of yours into a finely-tuned flying machine.
