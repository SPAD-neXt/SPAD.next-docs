# Pre-Requisites

Before we start flipping switches and soaring through the skies, let’s make sure you’ve got everything you need ready to go. Just like in real aviation, skipping your pre-flight checks is a fast track to a crash landing (metaphorically speaking, of course).\
Here’s what you’ll need on-board:\


✈️ X-Plane Installed & Ready - [https://www.x-plane.com/kb/digital-download-install/](https://www.x-plane.com/kb/digital-download-install/)\
Make sure X-Plane is installed, updated, and functioning properly. If it’s not, we’ll be grounded before we even taxi.\


🛠 SPAD.neXt Installed (Latest Version) - [https://docs.spadnext.com/getting-started/untitled](https://docs.spadnext.com/getting-started/untitled)\
Download and install the latest version of SPAD.neXt. Trust us—old versions are like using a paper map in an FMS world.\


SPAD.neXt X-Plane plugin installed into X-Plane - [https://www.spadnext.com/discover/how-to/connect-to-x-plane.html](https://www.spadnext.com/discover/how-to/connect-to-x-plane.html)\


🧭 DataRef Tool Installed in X-Plane - [https://docs.spadnext.com/simulations/x-plane/dataref-tool](https://docs.spadnext.com/simulations/x-plane/dataref-tool)\
This one’s important. The DataRef Tool is like your black box for figuring out what’s going on under the hood in X-Plane. It helps you find and test the datarefs you’ll use to connect your hardware to in-sim functions. Without it, you're basically flying blind when it comes to custom configurations.\


🖥 Supported Hardware - [https://docs.spadnext.com/getting-started/supported-hardware](https://docs.spadnext.com/getting-started/supported-hardware)\
Whether you’re using Logitech/Saitek panels, custom switches, or a Franken-rig you built in your garage, make sure your gear is connected and recognized by Windows.\


🧰 Basic Understanding of SPAD.neXt Interface - [https://docs.spadnext.com/guides-and-videos/new-user-series](https://docs.spadnext.com/guides-and-videos/new-user-series)\
You don’t need to be a systems engineer, but knowing your way around the SPAD.neXt interface will help a lot. Don’t worry—we’ll keep it smooth and turbulence-free. Using the in app video guides will keep you heading on the right course. \


📡 Network (Optional for Remote Panels/Devices)\
If you're running SPAD.neXt across multiple PCs or using remote panels, make sure your network setup is good to go. No one wants a cockpit that drops off the radar mid-flight.\
Once you’ve checked all this off, you're cleared to push back and start diving into the fun stuff!
