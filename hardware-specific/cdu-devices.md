## CDU Devices with HDMI Interface

To drive CDU devices with a HDMI connector through SPAD.neXt to get access to all extended features without needing to popout a window in the simulator, SPAD.neXt provides a RemoteCDUDisplay-Tool which will popout a customizable window. The tool can be found in the SPAD.neXt installation directory in the subfolder Tools/cdu. It can be run on a remote computer if necessary
