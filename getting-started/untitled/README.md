For normal operation, it is recommended to install SPAD.neXt at the default location, however if you would like to install SPAD.neXt somewhere else, you can change the location here.

**Due to Windows security restrictions, do not install SPAD.neXt to the Root-Folder of your system drive \(e.g. C:\SPAD.neXt\)! The software will not be able to access its necessary files. If in doubt, just click next**.

For review the selected location will be shown. And clicking on next will start the download process, if necessary.
