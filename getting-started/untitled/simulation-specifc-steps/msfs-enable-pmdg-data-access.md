* All Data in "PMDG 737 NGXu" should be working
* All Simulation Events in "PMDG 737 NGXu" should be working.
* Cockpitmaster CDU should be working right away

P3D PMDG 737 NGXu SPAD.neXt Profiles should be working.

Please remember PMDG Simulation Events work exactly like the cockpit. Use the "PMDG Special Actions" to do with the event what you would do in cockpit with the mouse!
