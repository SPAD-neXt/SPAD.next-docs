# SimConnect Configuration

SimConnect is a synonym for a protocol Microsoft published together with the FSX Acceleration Pack/SP2. All simulations that are based on FSX \(this includes Prepare3D and MS Flight Simulator 2020\) support this protocol. For a complete description of SimConnect and its feature please see [Microsoft's ESP Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/microsoft-esp/cc526948%28v=msdn.10%29).

No additional Installation is necessary on any client computer, since SPAD.neXt uses a built-in version of SimConnect. However, if you plan to user additional plugin/software that require SimConnect-Suport you might need to install the SimConnect Client Packages. See the simulator documetation on details.

If you plan to run SPAD.neXt on the same computer as the simulation runs on \(common case\), then the simulation should have all necessary configuration created already, and you can skip this steps.   
If later in the process of the configuration wizard you run into problems, get back to this pages to check the configrutaion.
