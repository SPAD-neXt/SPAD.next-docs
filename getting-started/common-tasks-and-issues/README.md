Please check the time synchronization on your computer. \
Due to heavy attacks to our services we had to increase the security, and requests with an invalid/outdated timestamp will be rejected. \
Your computer time most likely reports to differ from World Reference Time by more than 3 minutes. \
(Right click Windows Start icon -> Settings -> enter "time" -> Change Date/Time and make sure Synchronization is on)

### How to properly open a Support Ticket

1. Start SPAD.neXt
2. (reproduce problem)
3. in SPAD.neXt click in Settings->Support
4. and either Select **an exiting** ticket from the list and click on UPDATE TICKET or click on Create new ticket
5. Add any info needed and hit submit.

Note: if for reproducing the problem no simulation connection is needed please do so from a fresh SPAD.neXt start without Simulator running.\
If simulator is needed do it after a new start not after a over the pond flight\
It's no joy to gravel through megabytes of unnecessary logfiles if you update the ticket after a 5 hour flight. Processing of such tickets is declined.
