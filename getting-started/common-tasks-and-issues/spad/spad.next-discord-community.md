# SPAD.neXt discord community

Since there is no longer a forum for asking general question or getting a helping hand, there is a SPAD.neXt community discord for this purpose.

After the [Video-Guides](broken-reference) , the discord is the first stop ressource for any questions or problems.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note: The SPAD:neXt discord community is not a service run or maintained by SPAD.neXt. It's a seperate (free) product, which is used as tool.
{% endhint %}

## Joining the Discord Community

Please note that most of the channels on the SPD.neXt Community Discord are only accessible by licensed users.  You will only see a very few channels, and the only channel you can write to is #trial-users.\
This is the channel where you can ask general questions and our community experts will take care of it.
