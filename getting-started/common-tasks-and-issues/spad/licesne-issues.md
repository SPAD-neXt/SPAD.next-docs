# Licesne Issues

### Lost license information

* For licences bought before 12.11.2016 via SimMarket , simply login into your simmarket account at [https://secure.simmarket.com](https://secure.simmarket.com/) . Your license information is listed there.
* For licenses bought after 12.11.2016 via Avagate/2Checkout, you can login into you customer asccount at [https://secure.2co.com/myaccount/](https://secure.2co.com/myaccount/) to see you order history and license information.
* **If you have linked your license on the SPAD.neXt community Discord, you can ask the bot about your license details using the "!licinfo" command.**\
  \
  If this does not help, open a ticket from within SPAD.neXt to request your license information and attach a proof of purchase for the license. (Important: Mark it as license issue!)\
  \
  if you cannot start SPAD anymore, open a ticket via email (support at spadnext.com) from the email you used to purchase SPAD.neXt. If provide your ordernumber or a proof of purchase.

### "There is a Problem with your license, please contact support"

If your SPAD.neXt installation all of the sudden complains about a license problem, this is normally casued by a windows update changing vital information.

* Delete the file %APPDATA%\SPAD.neXt\SPAD.neXt.lic
* SPAD.neXt will start in trail mode and allows you to re-enter you license information
* if it still complains contact support@spadnext.com
