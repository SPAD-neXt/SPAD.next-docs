# Check Hardware

Before opening a support ticket because a device is not working, it is highly recommended to confirm your hardware is working correctly.&#x20;

For devices, that show up in Windows USB Gamecontrollers:

* [ ] Close SPAD.neXt and any flight sim
* [ ] open browser and navigate to [https://gamepad-tester.com/](https://gamepad-tester.com/)
* [ ] Select the device in question. (Device not listed: Hardware problem)
* [ ] Press all buttons / switches in questing, and observe if the B-values on the webpage will change.
* [ ] Values do **not** change: It's a hardware issue. Maybe USB cable not connected firmly

For Saitek Multipanel/Radiopanel/Switchpanel:

* [ ] You can download the old Saitek Testapplication [here](https://spadnext.com/download/SaitekDeviceTesters.zip)

For Midi devices:

For other devices:

* [ ] Close any FligthSim and open SPAD.neXt
* [ ] In SPAD.neXt enable the programming mode (the "Lego"-Icon next to the save icon on the lower left)
* [ ] Open the Event-Monitor , Undock it and start it.
* [ ] Press the switches/buttons in question
