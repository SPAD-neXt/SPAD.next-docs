Important:

Due to Windows security restrictions, SPAD.neXt and the simulation must be run with the same credentials. So, if you run the simulation as administrator you will have to do so as well for SPAD.neXt.

{% hint style="danger" %}
For SDAD.neXt to operate correctly in background the Windows Game Mode must be disabled.
