# MSFS: Lost profile aircraft assigments

* exit SPAD.neXt
* open windows file exlorer and navigate to %APPDATA%/SPAD.neXt/conf
* delete AircraftAssignments\_MSFS.xml
* copy AircraftAssignments\_FSX.xml to AircraftAssignments\_MSFS.xml
* edit AircraftAssignments\_MSFS.xml in notepad
* change Simulation="FSX" to Simulation="MSFS" in first line
* save and exit notepad, start spad.

For MSFS2024 the same procedure applies, just change Simulation="FSX" to Simulation="MSFS24" in first line and the file is called AircraftAssignments\_MSFS24.xml
