## Can my license be used on other computer also? So two computers?

If you have a complete edition license you can request a free secondary license via ticket.&#x20;

If you have a normal edition you will need to deactivate it always on the unused computer before activating it on the second one, else sooner or later the license server will blacklist it for license sharing.
