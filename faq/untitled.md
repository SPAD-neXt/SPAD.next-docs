# General FAQ

## Can my license be used on other computer also? So two computers?

If you have a complete edition license you can request a free secondary license via ticket.&#x20;

If you have a normal edition you will need to deactivate it always on the unused computer before activating it on the second one, else sooner or later the license server will blacklist it for license sharing.

## All my profiles are suddenly empty

Most likely your Documents folder got migrated to OneDrive by a Windows update.\
Possible solutions:

a) In SPAD.neXt head to Settings->Directories and alter the Documents-Folder to the new OneDrive folder

b) Move the SPAD.neXt-Folder back from OneDrive to the old location and keep profile local

## Does SPAD.neXt support device X?

If the device is explicitly listed in [Supported hardware](../getting-started/supported-hardware/) , then it's definitly supported. If the device shows up as a Joystick in Window USB-Gamedevices then it is supported as a General Joystick. You can enable and disable support for Joysticks in Settings->Devices->Joysticks

## Why does my Streamdeck show "not licensed" although it worked fine in trial?

Streamdeck support is a complete edition feature.\
You need to upgrade your license to complete edition (Settings->Regístration) or disable streamdeck support (Settings->Devices->Elgato). The free trial is equal to the complete edition license.
