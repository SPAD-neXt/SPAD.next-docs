You can switch rendering for ButtonGauges to the "future" Skia renderer in Settings->Application->Expert (Globally) or via a slider on the device (temporary) (No restart required,active instantly) Please report any major issues where buttons are rendered incorrectly&#x20;

Some slight render differences for textlayers **are expected**, specially if you defined a textbox that is too small to fit the text!
