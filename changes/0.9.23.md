**2025-09-14**

* Expressions: To reference a DEVICE-concrete data in an expression use "\[DEVICE:VARNAME:SERIAL]" e.g. "\[DEVICE:BRIGHTNESS:CL28J1A00419]" . When adding a device-data to an expression you can use the context-menu "Use concrete id" to copy the concrete name. This should **only** be used when accessing a data from a diffrent device! by default \[DEVICE:VARNAME] (e.g. \[DEVICE:BRIGHTNESS]) will be used, which will return the device-concrete varaiable of the device the expression is executed on \[DEVICE:VARNAME##SERIAL] is not a valid reference and will be evaluated as \[DEVICE:VARNAME] (See above)
